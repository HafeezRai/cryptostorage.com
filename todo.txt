faq
homepage

form info bubbles - see spec
form error messages - see spec
copy to clipboard confirmation - tooltip Copied!
file import loading - see spec, only show if minimum file size
environment checks: recommend links to download

designer:
homepage: tbd, fill icons with white, multiple locks, too big on small screens?
import keys success - inline or success page? dual tabs if import is inline
dependency management
	generate new keys button shows loading page (?) until all currency dependencies loaded
	warning bar saying dependencies are loading, then when done tell them they should disconnect to the internet
	what if clicked from homepage
warning sign badge with warning count in upper right blue bar
design opinions: notices, regenerate, form links, decryption progress, ommitted question mark
regenerate confirmation
notices on which pages
warn if private key not included in print - alert when print clicked without show private keys?
tip address
code review
option to split the passphrase and include a copy of it on each share?

low priority:
print progress - progress bar if threshold exceeded where they're expected to wait
minify dependencies with source map download
caching - etag dependencies, last modified tag, expire header will tell browser to cache
homepage re-hide more currencies: hide link underneath all of them if more than 4 rows
recover pulldown disabled styling improvements
another attempt at debugging bitaddress bip38 memory leak?
only paint key pair after it has rendered
save as txt and csv
pieces are blank until rendered, loading screen?
double click cryptostorage.html opens page in browser
try all imported file / key combinations to recover
prevent scroll revealing some of next picture
copy line break in pdf inserts space
console warning "unexpected end of file" in firefox caused by ddslick
timeouts in tests so browser doesn't lock
csv import to support "bring your own keys"
optimize tests by getting one set of keys of repeat_long size
verify no name collisions
code scan
minimize initial dependencies: condense files to single files, lazy load css
de-allocate elements on page re-renders
decomission export render when new render invoked
