error messages on key generation page - let them click button once, outline with red, deactivate until they fix.  Constrain split input and keep in sync
disable generate button until input valid? - let them click once then disable until error corrected
color of generate buttons / pulsing? - form button same as home page, maybe shift to darker
slider points, logos, and supporting content - fill icons with white, multiple locks
