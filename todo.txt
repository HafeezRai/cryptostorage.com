footer
notice color gradient
interoperability disclaimer if passphrase/split checked
precise static and dynamic dependencies
direct link to editor
piece incompatibilities: shareNum, currencies -> keypairs
increase test repeat
optimize private functions for performance
update bip38 cryptojs description with pbkdf if necessary
add support for dogecoin
tippls
import from txt string
test setPieceNum
ability to cancel import decryption, piece generation
on decrypt decrypt progress bar should show 0%, not getting 0% onProgress()
split validation should fail on -1
split form error remains highlighted after split disabled
see if there are wasteful loops in editor listeners

"Need one additional share to recover private key" is from keypair, but imported piece contains multiple private keys
tippy jerk when editor first loaded
compatability disclosure
backwards compatibility
file import incompatible pieces shows warning for developer, need to test user warnings

editor:
	bip38 support
	generate disabled, cancel enabled during generation
	save/print pop-ups
	floating forms bottom center if not enough width
	copied tooltip
	dev mode one of each button
	split lines bolder
	tweak floating button colors
	click outside dropdown only works if click within container
	keypair labels arrows

designer:
passphrase confirmation
split qr and lines white?
display interoperability warning if passphrase or split
how to make passphrase visible?
how to specify BIP38 encryption for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?
how to specify save type (json, csv, txt)?
are passphrase/split inputs hidden if unchecked?
what if floating regenerate/save/print controls cover form controls?
want to confirm generation and grouping flow (I have mockups)
currency inputs will be at bottom of generated storage which can be long.  Ok?
split piece selector is part of header, but is not config.  Worth moving?
crypto-cash faq and slider point

low priority:
view balance qr code on cryptocash
different print layouts
blue link against red notice is hard to read
info box on currencies
improve cryptocash design
crypto-cash reverse print slightly misaligned
ethereum logo not pushed down with 3 line encryption; replace character length with PK height
banner is pretty big on low resolution / landscape
firefox cache stops working after 3 loads, only shows error in export console
ddslick animation could be cleaner
mobile brave/firefox window.open returns null
cryptostorage.com/faq, etc
es6 with modules
let UI breath during bip38
1px whitespace on import progress bar
1px border on mobile safari import print
disable import new tabs if environment error
file import loading - see spec, only show if minimum file size
confirm navigate away from import if decrypting
export transactions which can be imported and sent making it fully functional cold storage web wallet
meeting times should be plus or minus 10% of time invested
option to split the passphrase and include a copy of it on each share?
print progress - progress bar if threshold exceeded where they're expected to wait
minify dependencies with source map download
import storage header is disabled at first, doesn't need to be
caching - etag dependencies, last modified tag, expire header will tell browser to cache
homepage re-hide more currencies: hide link underneath all of them if more than 4 rows
recover pulldown disabled styling improvements
another attempt at debugging bitaddress bip38 memory leak?
site did not work on devices on same ip simultaneously
pieces are blank until rendered, loading screen?
double click cryptostorage.html opens page in browser
try all imported file / key combinations to recover
prevent scroll revealing some of next picture
copy line break in pdf inserts space
timeouts in tests so browser doesn't lock
optimize tests by getting one set of keys of repeat_long size
verify no name collisions
code scan
minimize initial dependencies: condense files to single files, lazy load css
de-allocate elements on page re-renders
decomission export render when new render invoked
"pieces have different addresses" -> "pieces are incompatible" for import validation error
