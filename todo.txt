make progress bar its own controller

designer:
passphrase confirmation
split qr and lines white?
display interoperability warning if passphrase or split
how to make passphrase visible?
how to specify BIP38 encryption for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?
how to specify save type (json, csv, txt)?
are passphrase/split inputs hidden if unchecked?
what if floating regenerate/save/print controls cover form controls?
want to confirm generation and grouping flow (I have mockups)
currency inputs will be at bottom of generated storage which can be long.  Ok?
split piece selector is part of header, but is not config.  Worth moving?
crypto-cash faq and slider point

low priority:
view balance qr code on cryptocash
different print layouts
blue link against red notice is hard to read
info box on currencies
improve cryptocash design
crypto-cash reverse print slightly misaligned

recover pulldown disabled styling improvements
another attempt at debugging bitaddress bip38 memory leak?

pieces are blank until rendered, loading screen?
double click cryptostorage.html opens page in browser
try all imported file / key combinations to recover
prevent scroll revealing some of next picture
copy line break in pdf inserts space
timeouts in tests so browser doesn't lock
optimize tests by getting one set of keys of repeat_long size
