cryptostorage-v0.1.0-beta
- First release!
- Generate offline storage for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Keys are generated only in your device's browser so funds are never entrusted to a third party by design.
- 100% open source, client-side, and free to use.  No account necessary.
- Private keys can be passphrase-protected using CryptoJS.  Also supports BIP38 for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
- Storage can be divided into parts which can be geographically separated so funds are not accessible at any one location.
- Print or save to digital file for long-term storage.
- Recommendations are automatically provided to improve the security of the tool's environment:
	- Checks if the internet connection is active
	- Checks if the tool is downloaded and running locally
	- Checks if the browser is open source
	- Checks if the operating system is open source
- Supported tokens:
	- Bitcoin
	- Bitcoin Cash
	- Ethereum
	- Monero
	- Litecoin
